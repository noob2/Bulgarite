        Human activity in the lands of modern Bulgaria can be traced back to the Paleolithic.
        Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave are assumed to be the
        earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans.[6] Organised prehistoric societies
        in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture,[7] Vinƒça culture[8] and the
        eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing
        gold working and exploitation.[9][10] Some of these first gold smelters produced the
        coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world
        with an approximate age of over 6,000 years.[11] This site also offers insights for
        understanding the social hierarchy of the earliest European societies.

        Thracians, one of the three primary ancestral groups of modern Bulgarians,
        began appearing in the region during the Iron Age.[15] In the late 6th century BC, the
        Persians conquered most of present-day Bulgaria.[16][17][18] and kept it until 479 BC.
        With influence from the Persians,[18] the bulk of the Thracian tribes were united in the
        Odrysian kingdom in the 470s BC by king Teres,[19][20][21] but were later subjugated by
        Alexander the Great and by the Romans in 46 AD. After the division of the Roman Empire
        in 5th century the area fell under Byzantine control. By this time, Christianity had
        already spread in the region. A small Gothic community in Nicopolis ad Istrum produced the
        first Germanic language book in the 4th century, the Wulfila Bible.[22][23] The first
        Christian monastery in Europe was established around the same time by Saint Athanasius in
        central Bulgaria.[24] From the 6th century the easternmost South Slavs gradually settled
        in the region, assimilating the Hellenised or Romanised Thracians.

    <h3>First Bulgarian Empire</h3>

        In 680 Bulgar tribes,[14] under the leadership of Asparukh moved south across the Danube
        and settled in the area between the lower Danube and the Balkan, establishing their capital
        at Pliska.[27][28] A peace treaty with Byzantium in 681 marked the beginning of the First Bulgarian
        Empire. The Bulgars gradually mixed up with the local population, adopting a common language on
        the basis of the local Slavic dialect.[29]

        Succeeding rulers strengthened the Bulgarian state throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. Krum
        doubled the country's territory, killed Byzantine emperor Nicephorus I in the Battle of Pliska,
        [30] and introduced the first written code of law. Paganism was abolished in favour of Eastern
        Orthodox Christianity under Boris I in 864. This conversion was followed by a Byzantine recognition
        of the Bulgarian church[31] and the adoption of the Cyrillic alphabet developed at Preslav[32]
        which strengthened central authority and helped fuse the Slavs and Bulgars into a unified
        people.[33][34] A subsequent cultural golden age began during the 34-year rule of Simeon the
        Great, who also achieved the largest territorial expansion of the state.[35]

        Wars with Magyars and Pechenegs and the spread of the Bogomil heresy weakened Bulgaria after
        Simeon's death.[36][37] Consecutive Rus' and Byzantine invasions resulted in the seizure of
        the capital Preslav by the Byzantine army in 971.[38] Under Samuil, Bulgaria briefly recovered
        from these attacks,[39] but this rise ended when Byzantine emperor Basil II defeated the Bulgarian
        army at Klyuch in 1014. Samuil died shortly after the battle,[40] and by 1018 the Byzantines had
        ended the First Bulgarian Empire.
